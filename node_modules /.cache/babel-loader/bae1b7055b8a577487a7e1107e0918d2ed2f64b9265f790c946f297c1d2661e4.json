Additionally, we thought of adding some kind of social \n                aspect, similar to stories on Instagram or Snapchat, where users \n                can post pictures from events. We also had the idea of a card carousel \n                to display events. Finally, we thought about using a gumball style circle that increases in size accroding to the number of people attending the event, containing the profiles of the users attending. \n                </p>\n            \n            </section>\n\n            <section className=\"assignment-part\" style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>\n                <h2>First Iteration Wireframing</h2>\n                <p>\n                Based on the initial sketches, we created a first wireframe iteration.

For incoming events,\n                the user can swipe left/right to show if they are attending or not. \n                Additionally, the user can scroll vertically to see upcoming events\n                and past events. They are able to click on \"Trends\" to navigate\n                to the \"Trends\" page where they will find party themes, resturants/food,\n                and venues. They can click on the \"Friends\" page to navigate to \n                users' highlights where a user can click on the highlight and see\n                a polariod picture post from the party.
